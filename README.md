# DESCRIPTION OF TASK LIKE HOW YOU PERFORMED AND WHAT YOU HAVE DONE AND PASTE PICTURES OF OUTPUT
Screen 1: Login Page (iPad mini 8.3 - 1)
Design Overview:
This is the login screen for the Smart Home app.
The UI uses a clean, modern green gradient background that gives it a smart, calm aesthetic suitable for home automation.
At the top is a house icon with the title "Smart Home", making the purpose of the app immediately clear.
User Interface Elements:
Text fields for Email and Password are displayed with rounded corners for a soft, friendly look.
A large "Log In" button is placed prominently, encouraging user interaction.
Below the login button, a small prompt “Don’t have an account yet? Create an account” invites new users to sign up.

Screen 2: Home Dashboard (iPad mini 8.3 - 2)
Design Overview:
Once logged in, the user reaches the main control dashboard labeled "MY SMART HOME."
The background continues the green gradient theme for design consistency.
User Interface Elements:
The screen displays four main control tiles:
Living Room Lights (ON) – blue tile highlights it’s active.
Thermostat (22°C) – standard temperature control.
Front Door Lock (LOCKED).
Outdoor Camera (ACTIVE).
A microphone icon is centered at the bottom, labeled “Tap to Speak or say ‘Hey Smart Home’”, guiding the user to initiate voice control.
A navigation bar appears below with icons for Home, Account, Voice Control, and Settings.

Screen 3: Voice Command in Progress (iPad mini 8.3 - 3)
Design Overview:
This screen represents the voice recognition phase. The app is actively listening to a command.
Voice Interaction:
The text “Listening… Turn off the Lights” appears above the mic icon.
This visual cue gives real-time feedback to the user that the app has heard the voice command.
Device Status:
The interface remains largely the same as in Screen 2, maintaining familiarity while changing only dynamic elements to avoid confusion.

Screen 4: Command Executed Confirmation (iPad mini 8.3 - 4)
Design Overview:
The app confirms that the command has been executed successfully.
Visual Feedback:
A green banner at the top shows “Lights turned off in Living Room” with a check icon – a confirmation cue.
The Living Room tile changes to OFF, confirming that the light is now turned off.
The thermostat tile remains the same, while the others continue to reflect their current state (LOCKED/ACTIVE).
The mic icon and navigation bar remain, keeping interaction fluid and consistent.

Overall UX Highlights:
Consistency in Layout & Color Scheme: The green and blue tones across all screens promote brand consistency and a sense of calm control.
Clear Voice Interaction Flow: Visual and text cues guide the user from issuing to confirming voice commands.
Device Feedback: Smart home device statuses (ON, OFF, LOCKED, ACTIVE) are clearly displayed on intuitive, tappable tiles.
Accessibility: Large fonts, icon-based navigation, and real-time voice response improve the app’s usability for a wide range of users.

Conclusion:
This Figma design effectively represents a user-friendly, voice-controlled smart home interface. It simplifies complex smart device management into a clean dashboard with visual feedback, real-time voice response, and a cohesive color system, making it both accessible and intuitive
